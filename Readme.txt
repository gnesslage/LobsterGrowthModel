The Comprehensive Growth Model Version 1 (compgV1) estimates von Bertalanffy growth model parameters using a combination of length-frequency analysis and a growth increment model. Time-varying growth rate (k) is estimated assuming growth is a linear function of growing degree days.Data inputs include a combination of length frequency and mark-recapture data. 

CompgV1_SimulationModel_tvK.R provides users with a simple simulation modeling framework to generate simulated data sets with which to test the model under a suite of scenarios. The .dat and .ctl files provided are simulated data generated from this code.

Please use with caution. Although the model has been simulation tested under a limited set of scenarios, it is work in progress and will continue to be refined and further developed for use in the 2025 American lobster stock assessment. Please watch this repo for futher developments.
